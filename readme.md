# pager
##### Built with Laravel. Tested with Travis.
A simple application that allows an organization to keep in touch with it's members via text using email to text gateways.

This was an application built for a fire department in order for them to be able to send out notifications about what is going on around the department. It also receives "Rip and Runs" from dispatch and texts out any incoming runs to members.

I used this opportunity to work with MetroUI CSS framework instead of Bootstrap. After using Metro in this project, the main complaint about it would be that there is no responsiveness in version 3.0, besides that it was a decent framework and provided a different look out of the box.
